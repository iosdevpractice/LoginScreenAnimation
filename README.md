Login Screen Animation
==============

My soultion to the [second
challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/comments/2dfmdp/08132014_ios_challenge_2_login_screen_animation/) from [/r/iOSChallenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSChallenges/).

I went with Swift again. This was my first exposure to custom
view controller transitions and gradients. Good stuff. Check out my [blog
post](http://www.iosdevpractice.com/2014/08/23/login-screen-animation/) for more information.
